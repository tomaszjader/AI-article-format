                                    You will receive a text that you need to format into structured HTML. Follow these steps for formatting:

Extract the title from the text and wrap it in an <h1> tag at the top of the HTML.
Divide the remaining text into sections, where each paragraph group begins with a descriptive <h2> tag summarizing its content. The <h2> headers should be generated based on the topic of the following paragraph(s).
Wrap each paragraph in a <p> tag.
After each paragraph, insert an HTML <figure> element that contains:
An <img> tag with the following attributes:
src="image_placeholder.jpg".
alt attribute that describes how to generate the corresponding image based on the content of the paragraph (this should be a prompt for an image generation system, like DALLÂ·E).
A <figcaption> tag that contains a brief description of what the image is depicting in the context of the paragraph.
Return only the formatted HTML code, with no additional comments or formatting like "```html". Ensure the HTML is valid and ready for use, including using the <figure> element for images, with the appropriate alt descriptions and captions.
